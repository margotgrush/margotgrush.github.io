# About me

Since April 2024, I am a Research Associate for Bayesian Statistics and Causal Inference at [School of Public Health, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/school-public-health), working with [Verena Zuber](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/v.zuber) and [Leonardo Bottolo](https://github.com/lb664). My main research focus lies in discovering patterns and causal relationship in single-cell genomic and genetic variation data with tools from Bayesian statistics, such as model-based clustering and latent factor analysis.

In 2023, I obtained my PhD at Vienna University of Economics and Business under the supervision of [Sylvia Fr端hwirth-Schnatter](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/statmath/faculty-staff/faculty/sfruehwirthschnatter) and [Alfred Stiassny](https://research.wu.ac.at/en/persons/alfred-stiassny-4). My dissertation titled "Bayesian methods for unsupervised data analysis in application to data sets exhibiting non-Gaussianity" was devoted to discovering structure in complex data with no or minimal initial assumptions. It comprises of three parts which include a comprehensive review of infinite factorisiation models, a model that relaxes the assumtion of Gaussian factors habitual in Bayesian latent factor models, and a flexible mixture of factor analysers model which provides fully automatic detection of both clusters in the data set and latent dimensions in each cluster. The latter paper, which has recently been published in [Bayesian Analysis](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bayesian-analysis/advance-publication/Dynamic-Mixture-of-Finite-Mixtures-of-Factor-Analysers/10.1214/25-BA1543.full), employs the connection between infinite nonparametric priors and their finite counterparts to provide a fully automatic inference on data structure without resorting to infinite models.

Prior to that, I worked for several years at [Erste Group](https://www.erstegroup.com/en/home) as a Quantitative Analyst in charge of time series modeling and macroecnomic forecasting. My detailed CV can be found here: [CV](CV.pdf)
