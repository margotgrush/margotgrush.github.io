# About me

Since April 2024, I am a Research Associate for Bayesian Statistics and Causal Inference at [School of Public Health, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/school-public-health), working with [Verena Zuber](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/v.zuber) and [Leonardo Bottolo](https://www.c2d3.cam.ac.uk/directory/266/dr-leonardo-bottolo).

In 2023, I obtained my PhD at the Vienna University of Economics and Business under the supervision of [Sylvia Frühwirth-Schnatter](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/statmath/faculty-staff/faculty/sfruehwirthschnatter) and [Alfred Stiassny](https://research.wu.ac.at/en/persons/alfred-stiassny-4). My dissertation title is "Bayesian methods for unsupervised data analysis in application to data sets exhibiting non-Gaussianity". Prior to that, I worked for several years at [Erste Group](https://www.erstegroup.com/en/home) as a Quantitative Analyst. My detailed CV can be found here: [CV](CV.pdf)

# Miscellanea

I love music and have studied classical piano and vocals for some years. I have also attended several summer schools in jazz at the [Guildhall School of Music and Drama](https://www.gsmd.ac.uk) as well as had some amateur performances at various events.
